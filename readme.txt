We created the Black Friday plugin because we wanted an all-in-one solution for our sales events. Creating events in WooCommerce requires buying many different plugins that don't talk to each other. This plugin handles the sale itself as well as the promotions.

**Is this just for Black Friday and Cyber Monday?**
Definitely not! Once we created the Black Friday plugin we realized it will work wonders for other events like Memorial Day sales, Customer Appreciation events, and more!

We are continuing to add new features to this amazing plugin. If you have suggestions we'd love to hear it! Email <a href="mailto:us@pimwick.com">us@pimwick.com</a> and tell us what you want to see next.
